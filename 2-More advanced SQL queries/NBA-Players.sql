-- DATA BIG PROJECT:

-- Pick one of those data sets or create a data set like that,
-- and use advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data.
-- What sort of questions might one have about that data,
-- like if they were using it for an app or a business idea? Here are some ideas:

-- What are average, max, and min values in the data?
-- What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
-- What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)?
-- What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?
